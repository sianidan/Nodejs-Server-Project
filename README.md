# Node.js Server Project
I created this simple server to complete an assignment for the Full-Stack program with Reskill Americans. 

## About
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a server with 3 routes using **only Node.js**: 
- a homepage w/ a welcome message and dummy image
- a page with a table of data fetched from an API
- an error page
